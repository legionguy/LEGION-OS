HI , WELCOME TO LEGION OS

WHAT I DO ??

our main focus is to make stuff for users as much as possible in config.nix and setup system as fast as possible with everything you need beautifully according to your job 

WHAT DO I USE ??

we use home manager ansd nix repo

HOW CAN I CONTRIBUTE ??

open a pr and left everything on me

WHAT I SHOULD NOT DO WHILE CONTRIBUTING ?? 

dont open pr just to fuck around or update readme

UPDATE - i am thinking that nix is not for me , like i dont have to configure stuff using bash and config which is making my knowledge fade away besides i cant setup plymount for splash screen and there is no well documented lang tutorial . i think its time to finally more arch AGAIN <:pog:832277393527930940>  or i can try guix
